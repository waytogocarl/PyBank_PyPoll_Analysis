PyBank, PyPoll Analysis

I created a Python script to analyze financial records from a dataset, calculating total months, net profit/loss, average changes, and identifying the greatest increases and decreases in profits.

Here's a screenshot of the PyBank results:

Next I developed a Python script to analyze election data, calculating total votes, candidate percentages, and determining the election winner based on popular vote.

Here's a screenshot of the PyPoll results:

My core responsibilities in this project were writing the script to process the data, performing calculations, and generating a summary report.

During this process I used Python, Pandas, and CSV's.
