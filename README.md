PyBank, PyPoll Analysis

I created a Python script to analyze financial records from a dataset, calculating total months, net profit/loss, average changes, and identifying the greatest increases and decreases in profits.

Next I developed a Python script to analyze election data, calculating total votes, candidate percentages, and determining the election winner based on popular vote.


My core responsibilities in this project were writing the script to process the data, performing calculations, and generating a summary report.
During this process I used Python, Pandas, and CSV's.
